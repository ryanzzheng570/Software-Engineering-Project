## Project: Mini-Shopify
### Description
Merchant can create a new shop by filling in a form containing: the name of the shop, the categories/tags relevant to the           shop, and other fields that are up to you. The Merchant can upload products to populate the shop along with a description, picture, and inventory number. Customers can find a shop by looking up the name of the shop or searching by category/tag. Once they find the shop the want, they can browse through the product catalog of the shop, and can then decide to purchase one or many products by putting them in the Shopping Cart and proceeding to Checkout. The purchase itself will obviously be simulated, but purchases cannot exceed the inventory.
### Added Technology
